# procrastination-pal-ai

## Description

This repo houses our backend AI service, which responds to textual queries and makes API calls to edit our database accordingly. Our primary backend repo may be found [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98-23f/ProcrastinationPal_backend/tree/main), and our frontend repo, which has more robust project documentation, may be found [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98-23f/procrastination-pal-frontend).

## Setup

- Ensure that the [primary backend server](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98-23f/ProcrastinationPal_backend/tree/main) is running.
- Before running any of the app's backend, make sure you have the proper `.env` file in `/src`. If you don't have it, Slack Carter for it.
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements.
- `cd` into `/src` and run `python app.py` or `python3 app.py` to get things started.
