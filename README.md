# procrastination-pal-ai

## Description

This repo houses our backend AI service, which responds to textual queries and makes API calls to edit our database accordingly. Our primary backend repo may be found [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98-23f/ProcrastinationPal_backend/tree/main), and our frontend repo, which has more robust project documentation, may be found [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98-23f/procrastination-pal-frontend).
